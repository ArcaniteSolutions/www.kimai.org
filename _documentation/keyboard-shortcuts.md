Kimai supports a couple of keyboard shortcuts, which can be used on most pages.

The keyboard shortcuts can be invoked by the platform specific "trigger key combination" and the app specific `access key`. 

- For Windows users, use `Alt + shift` + `[access key]`
- For Mac users, use `control + option` + `[access key]`

The global `access keys` in Kimai are:
- `s` - for stop: stops the currently running timesheet (works on every page) 
- `n` -  for new: opens the "create timesheet" form (works on every page)
- `a` - for add: opens the add dialog (if available on that page, e.g. customer listing) 
- `q` - for query: opens the search dialog (if available on that page, e.g. project listing) 
- `h` - for help: opens the documentation link (if available on that page, e.g. users listing)

The `access keys` work in lowercase and uppercase.
