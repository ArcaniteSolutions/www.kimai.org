The Kimai dashboard displays (so called) `widgets`.
The ones shipped by default can be changed, re-ordered or completely removed.

Since Kimai version 2 the dashboard can be configured directly in the frontend and every user can have his own set of widgets.

Each widget can have its own set of required permissions, so different user roles see different widgets.

Upon clicking the {% include demo-action-button.html icon="fas fa-cog" title="Preferences" %} button in the top right corner, you can configure the dashboard.
